# Exposure to Gaussian Process (GPs)

This repository houses the Ipython Notebooks for implementation of via Gaussian Process which serves complement the contents of the website hosted [here](https://sites.google.com/view/exposure-to-gp/home). To access, open a local copy via Binder (Docker). This will allow you to run the notebook shells and modify the code to your liking.

Do leave a [feedback](https://sites.google.com/view/exposure-to-gp/feedback) to let me know what you feel about the contents and if there are any modifications/typos that need to be taken care of. Additionally, if you wish to pool resources by contributing to this journey, I would be more than happy if you could fill out this [work request form](https://sites.google.com/view/exposure-to-gp/feedback/contribute) to reach out to me.

I hope that after reading through the contents, you would gain some clarity as to what GPs really are. It is my understanding that the best way to learn is by getting your hands dirty. So, get right to it !!
